  <h1 style="color: red;">☕️ Hi ! Welcome on my GitHub Profile </h1>

<h2>🍻 Who I am ? </h2>

<p> I'm a Romanian wannabe developer, trying to learn javascript and python. I enjoy coding and deep learning.<3</p>

<h2>💻 My Work </h2>

<p>There is my portfolio that is dedicated for this category, here it is : <a href="https://skyluetz.me/" target="_blank">Link</a>. Empty for the time being while I actually learn something...</p>

<h2>🛠 What you will find here ? </h2>

<p> You will find all my projects with their codes so you can maybe take some ideas from them. I will not post everything, but I am trying to tend to a profile that is able to show all my skills for any recruiters that is concerned by my profile.</p>
